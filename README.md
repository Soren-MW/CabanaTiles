**CabanaTiles** is a letter-based game in which players compete against time, challenging themselves to utilize all their tiles by spelling out valid, connected English words in a changing board. The game starts with a set of 21 randomly drawn tiles. Players drag and drop these tiles together in a strip of connected words, similar to a crossword. The layout is intended for desktop or mouse and keyboard players.

Once all tiles from the rack are used up in legal words, a "boogie" is initiatedâ€”adding a new tile from the shared pool. When players find themselves stuck in a situation with a difficult letter, a "shakeup" can be done by right-clicking a tile, which exchanges the unwanted tile for three new random tiles. The game is over when the pool of tiles is depleted and all tiles are properly placed in a connected arrangement of legal words. A multiplayer version is in the pipeline!
